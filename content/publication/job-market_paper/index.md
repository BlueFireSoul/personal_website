abstract: "This paper examines the impact of zoning policies on housing affordability and welfare inequality across income groups in the Greater Boston area. We focus on two specific regulations: Floor Area Ratio (FAR) restrictions and density regulations, both of which limit the supply of smaller, affordable housing units. Using a housing supply model, we show that these policies significantly reduce housing affordability, with the tract-level most affordable housing being, on average, ten times more expensive under zoning constraints. To evaluate the welfare effects of these policies, we incorporate the housing supply model into a spatial general equilibrium framework that captures both housing demand and supply across census tracts in the city. Our baseline results indicate that removing zoning policies leads to a 70% welfare gain for the lowest 10% income group due to improved housing affordability and the large income disparity across groups. When externalities, such as preferences for neighborhood income composition, are considered, the welfare effect for the lowest income group increases to 140%, while middle-income households experience a welfare loss of 15%. These results suggest that while eliminating zoning policies can dramatically improve welfare for low-income households, it introduces welfare losses for middle-income groups due to shifts in neighborhood composition. This research highlights the significant role of zoning policies in exacerbating housing affordability issues and underscores the importance of considering distributional effects when evaluating zoning policy reforms."
