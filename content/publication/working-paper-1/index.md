abstract: This paper investigates the impact of spatial distance from migrants’ place of origin on fertility and mobility outcomes. Using U.S. survey data, I first show a discernible decrease in fertility likelihood with increasing distances from one’s hometown, pointing to a ”proximity preference” for fertility. The absence of familial support systems at greater distances and unfamiliar surroundings may dissuade long-distance migrants from childbearing. To assess the extent to which this proximity preference has impacted fertility and mobility outcomes, I introduce a spatial equilibrium model with endogenous fertility decisions. My counterfactual experiments underline the considerable influence of this proximity preference on both mobility and fertility patterns. Notably, skilled workers exhibit a more pronounced proximity preference in fertility limiting their fertility and mobility outcomes. My analysis further estimates that shifts in migration patterns can explain approximately 5% of the changes in fertility rates since 2000.
